# Flame Tweaks
This is the source code for a website that allows you to construct and download a modular resource pack for Minecraft, providing an assortment of minor tweaks.

I generally only support one version of the game at once, and it's not always the latest version. I don't take requests, though I'm open to suggestions.

## Features
- [x] Distinguishable growth stages: wheat, carrots, potatoes, nether wart, beetroot
- [x] Blinking: dispensers, droppers, observers, ender eyes, totems of undying
- [x] Ender pearls slowly cycle through the colors of the rainbow
- [x] Soul fire (torches, flames, lanterns, campfires) is renamed Alurien Flame
- [x] Ancient Debris and Nether Scrap is retextured and renamed to Nether Flux.
- [x] end.ogg (The obnoxious machinegun sounding end track) is replaced with with C418 - Ki
- [x] Notch apple retextured with trans pride flag and renamed to "Pride Apple"
- [x] Glow lichen is colored like cave vine (to avoid confusion with diamond ore)

## Wishlist
- [ ] Compass break texture
- [ ] Digital clock
- [ ] Custom paintings
- [ ] Animated ores
- [ ] Animated nether scrap
- [ ] Blinking chiseled deepslate
- [ ] Grass variants with flowers
